This passionate, often surprising, intimate record, kept under lock and key for some forty years in Mexico, reveals many new dimensions in the complex persona of this remarkable Mexican artist. Covering the years 1944-45, the 170-page journal contains Frida\'s thoughts, poems, and dreams, and reflects her stormy relationship with her husband, Diego Rivera, Mexico\'s famous artist. The seventy watercolor illustrations in the journal - some lively sketches, several elegant self-portraits, others complete paintings - offer insights into her creative process, and show her frequently using the journal to work out pictorial ideas for her canvases. The text entries, written in Frida\'s round, full script in brightly colored inks, add an almost decorative quality, making the journal as captivating to look at as it is to read. Frida\'s childhood, her political sensibilities, and her obsession with Diego are all illuminated in witty phrases and haunting images. Although much has been written recently about this extraordinary woman, Frida Kahlo\'s art and life continue to fascinate the world. This personal document, published in a complete full-color facsimile edition, will add greatly to the understanding of her unique and powerful vision and her enormous courage in the face of more than thirty-five operations to correct injuries she had sustained in an accident at the age of eighteen.

When they first meet on a trolley p Tom Cole, the grandson of a legendary local hero, has inherited an uncanny knack for reading the Niagara River\'s whims and performing daring feats of rescue at the mighty falls. And like the tumultuous meeting of the cataract\'s waters with the rocks below, a chance encounter between Tom and 17-year-old Bess Heath has an explosive effect. When they first meet on a trolley platform, Bess immediately recognizes the chemistry between them, and the feeling is mutual.  But the hopes of young love are constrained by the 1915 conventions of Niagara Falls, Ontario. Tom\'s working-class pedigree doesn\'t suit Bess\'s family, despite their recent fall from grace. Sacked from his position at a hydroelectric power company, Bess\'s father has taken to drink, forcing her mother to take in sewing for the society women who were once her peers. Bess pitches in as she pines for Tom, but at her young age, she\'s unable to fully realize how drastically her world is about to change.  Set against the resounding backdrop of the falls, Cathy Marie Buchanan\'s carefully researched, capaciously imagined debut novel entwines the romantic trials of a young couple with the historical drama of the exploitation of the river\'s natural resources. The current of the river, like that of the human heart, is under threat: \"Sometimes it seems like the river is being made into this measly thing,\" says Tom, bemoaning the shortsighted schemes of the power companies. \"The river\'s been bound up with cables and concrete and steel, like a turkey at Christmastime.\"  Skillfully portraying individuals, families, a community, and an environment imperiled by progress and the devastations of the Great War,   beautifully evokes the wild wonder of its setting, a wonder that always overcomes any attempt to tame it. But at the same time, Buchanan\'s tale never loses hold of the gripping emotions of Tom and Bess\'s intimate drama. The result is a transporting novel that captures both the majesty of nature and the mystery of love. Also, download the free study guide:  .', '2009', 'Hachette Books', '1401340970', 6, 11, 0, 307);

Characters and reader alike are quickly carried beyond familiar territory here, into the unsettled ground of science, faith, and everyday truces between reason and conviction.  Dellarobia Turnbow is a restless farm wife who gave up her own plans when she accidentally became pregnant at seventeen. Now, after a decade of domestic disharmony on a failing farm, she has settled for permanent disappointment but seeks momentary escape through an obsessive flirtation with a younger man. As she hikes up a mountain road behind her house to a secret tryst, she encounters a shocking sight: a silent, forested valley filled with what looks like a lake of fire. She can only understand it as a cautionary miracle, but it sparks a raft of other explanations from scientists, religious leaders, and the media. The bewildering emergency draws rural farmers into unexpected acquaintance with urbane journalists, opportunists, sightseers, and a striking biologist with his own stake in the outcome. As the community lines up to judge the woman and her miracle, Dellarobia confronts her family, her church, her town, and a larger world, in a flight toward truth that could undo all she has ever believed.

Clouds of war are gathering over a fogbound London.

Spirits are high as the ship leaves Norway: five men and eight huskies, crossing the Barents Sea by the light of the midnight sun. At last they reach the remote, uninhabited bay where they will camp for the next year, Gruhuken, but the Arctic summer is brief. As night returns to claim the land, Jack feels a creeping unease.
